# About drivers in this project

In this directory you should set up a **driver for the Google Chrome** (chromedriver.exe) matching your browser version.

Currently, chromedriver.exe is ignored by this repository because browser versions at different stations may be different.

Proper driver management is to be implemented in newer versions of this project.
